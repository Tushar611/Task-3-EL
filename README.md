# Task-3-EL
This is my Third task repo of Elevate Labs internship

In this we have done 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following 4 Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards were created:

Total Revenue: This is the total sum of the Discounted Price column, which shows the total sales.

Total Items Sold: This is derived from amazon.csv (Count) and shows the total number of products sold.

Average Customer Rating: This is the average of the Rating column, indicating customer satisfaction.

Average Discount: This is the average of the Discount Percentage column.

Graphs and Charts
The following 2 main graphs and charts were created:

Revenue by Category (Bar Chart): This chart shows how much total revenue (sales) was generated by each product Category, helping to identify the top-selling categories.

Price vs. Rating (Scatter Plot): This chart shows the relationship between Discounted Price and Rating. It is used to analyze whether more expensive products receive better ratings.

Dashboard Components
The final dashboard includes the following components:

Layout: The dashboard is arranged with the four (4) KPI cards at the top. Below them, the two graphs (Bar Chart and Scatter Plot) are placed side-by-side.

Interactivity: The dashboard is fully interactive. Clicking on any category in the bar chart automatically updates all KPIs and the other graph to display data for only that selected category.
